        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        
        <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to create webpages. Web browsers read the HTML files 
        and turn them into visible webpages that people can view. The webpage you are viewing right now utilizes HTML! The language is written 
        using tags inside angle brackets, which are not visible on the actual webpage, and these tags dictate how the webpage is designed and 
        viewed. The birth of HTML started with Tim Berners-Lee, its creator. When he created HTML, he was an independent contractor with CERN, 
        or the European Organization for Nuclear Research.  </p>
