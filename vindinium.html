        <h1>What is Vindinium?</h1>
        
        <p>Vindinium is an Artificial Intelligence programming challenge, where you create a program in order to control your bot and fight 
        against bots created by other players. The premise of the game is for your bot to collect mines scattered around the map, which generate 
        gold for you when they are in your possession. The winner of the game is the bot with the most gold after a certain amount of turns.
        However, there is more to the game than just this. Your bot can attack another bot if close enough, and if your bot kills that enemy bot,
        you will steal all the mines that it owned. There are also taverns where you can spend the gold you earned in order to heal up. The key 
        tomaking a good AI for Vindinium is a combination of algorithms that incorporate healing, attacking, and claiming mines.</p>
        
        <h1>My Vindinium Code</h1>
        
        <h2>Richest Bot</h2>
        
        <p><code><pre>
        var tycoonBot = enemyBots[0];
        for (i = 0; i < enemyBots.length; i++) {
            if (bot.yourBot.mineCount < enemyBots[i].mineCount) {
                tycoonBot = enemyBots[i];
            }
        }
        </pre></code></p>
        
        <p>This block of code determines which enemy bot has more mines than my bot. In my first line of code, I named my variable tycoonBot, and 
        made it refer to the enemy bots. In the second line, the for loop cycles through the three enemy bots by increasing i by 1. The third 
        line is an if statement that compares my bot's mine count with the mine counts of the enemy bots that were cycled through. The enemy bot 
        with the most mines compared to me is then made to be tycoonBot.</p>
        
        <h2>The Decision Tree</h2>
        
        <p><code><pre>
        if(bot.yourBot.life <= 30 || bot.yourBot.mineCount > 4 && bot.yourBot.life <= 99 && bot.yourBot.gold > 300) {
            task = "getDranks";
        }
        
        else if(bot.yourBot.life >= 50 && bot.freeMines < 1) {
            task = "attack";
        }
        
        else {
            task = "freemines";
        }
        </pre></code></p>
        
        <p>This if/else list determines the conditions that have to be met in order for certain tasks to be executed. The list works by first 
        checking if the conditions in the first if statement are true. If so, the task I assigned to it will run. If not, the program will check 
        if the second decision, the else if statement, has its conditions met. If so, the task will run, and if not, the next decision is checked,
        and so on. The first if statement gives the conditions for the "getDranks" task, which is the task for going to the nearest tavern and 
        healing. The conditions are either my bot's health is at or below 30, OR my bot has more than 4 mines, my bot is below max health, AND my
        bot has more than 300 gold. The second part of the tree gives the conditions for my bot to seek out other bots and attack them. My bot 
        must be at or above 50 health, and there must not be any free mines left in order for it to run the "attack" task. The last part of the 
        decision tree is the else statement, which means that if none of the above mentioned conditions are met, the task to collect unowned 
        mines will be run.</p>
        
        <h2>Healing</h2>
        
        <p><code><pre>
        if(task === "getDranks") {
            var closestTavern = bot.taverns[0];
            for(i = 0; i < bot.taverns.length; i++) {
                if(bot.findDistance(myPos, closestTavern) > bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.taverns[i])) {
                    closestTavern = bot.taverns[i];
                }
            }
            console.log("This doesn't taste like cream soda...");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closestTavern);
        }
        </pre></code></p>
        
        <p>This block of code makes it so that when the "getDranks" task is activated, my bot will find the closest tavern. I named the variable 
        "closestTavern", and made it refer to an array of all the taverns on the map. Then, the for loop cycles through all the tavern locations, 
        compares each tavern's distance to my bot's location. The closest tavern is then made to be the variable closestTavern. The next part of 
        this code is a console.log that displays a message when the bot goes for a drink. Finally, the direction my bot goes is determined, 
        which is from the bot's current position to the position of the closest tavern.</p>
        
        <h2>Claiming Mines</h2>
        
        <p><code><pre>
        if(task === "freemines") {
            var closestMine = bot.freeMines[0];
            for(i = 0; i < bot.freeMines.length; i++) {
                if(bot.findDistance(myPos, closestMine) > bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.freeMines[i])) {
                    closestMine = bot.freeMines[i];
                }
            }
            console.log("Claiming real estate!");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closestMine);
        }
        </pre></code></p>
        
        <p>This block of code is very similar to the previous one, and makes it so that when the "freemines" task is run, the bot will find the
        nearest unowned mine. I named the variable "closestMine", and made it refer to an array of all the unowned mines on the map. A for loop
        cycles through all the unowned mines, and compares the distances of all the free mines from my position. The mine closest to my bot's 
        position is defined as the closestMine variable. The code then has a console.log that displays a message stating that my bot is claiming
        a mine. Finally, the direction my bot is going is set to the closest mine.</p>
        
        <h2>Attacking</h2>
        
        <p><code><pre>
        if(task === "attack") {
            console.log("Slaying nearest peasant!");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, [tycoonBot.pos.x, tycoonBot.pos.y]);
        }
        </pre></code></p>
        
        <p>This final code block of mine determines where my bot will go when the "attack" task is run. Since the bots already come with the 
        ability to attack other bots when they are 1 space away, there is no need for me to program how to attack. All I need to do is 
        determine where to go, which should be the bot with the most mines, which was already defined in the Richest Bot section. This code 
        displays a message stating that my bot is attacking, and sets the direction it is going with the coordinates of tycoonBot.</p>
        
        <h1>What I Learned</h1>
        
        <p>roughout this project, I learned a lot about Javascript programming and AI, all while having a lot of fun. I expanded my knowledge on 
        Javascript terminology and commands, and how to utilize them. I also learned about the hard work needed in order to properly program 
        Artificial Intelligence. The AI must have very specific and holistic commands in order to function how I want it to, which requires a 
        lot of combing through coding. Overall, this project was very enjoyable, and I gained a new perspective on programming.</p>
